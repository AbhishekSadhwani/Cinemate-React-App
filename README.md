# Cinemate

Cinemate is a movie information web application developed using ReactJS for a responsive user experience, the sleek styling of TailwindCSS, and libraries like React Router for seamless navigation. The goal of this project is to gain an understanding of working with APIs, making fetch calls using async functions, and working with react hooks.
